# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of this activity is to use various techniques to create a model based on loan risk. ChatGPT was used to help with the code. 
The main code is contained in the credit_risk_classification.ipynb file. The Credit Risk Analysis is written below.

**Credit Risk Analysis is below:**

**Explain the purpose of this analysis:**
This analysis was done to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credit risk of various borrowers from different lending services. It is important to have an accurate model in real life, because an inaccurate model could have disastrous results for a company's bottom line and result in financial losses. 

**Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.**
-Accuracy Score of 95.20%: This accuracy score means that 92.5% of the model's predictions were correect bassed on two key factors: the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and the specificity (true negative rate) of the model
-Precision Score of 92%: This precision score means that 92% of "predicted positives" were correct
-Recall Score of 95%: This recall score means that the model was 95% correct in measuring "true positive" values

**Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.**
Overall, yes: I would recommend using this model for use by the company. There was an overall >95% accuracy in predicting the correct payment of loans by borrowers, based on the recall score. That accuracy is high enough where the company could still make a reasonable profit form this model without too much risk.
